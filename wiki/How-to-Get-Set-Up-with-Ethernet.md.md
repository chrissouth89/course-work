# Getting Set Up With Ethernet

1. Get a tape measure and measure how much cable you will need.  You should walk along from your router/modem and follow your floor/ceiling/baseboard/around doors - so that you are ready to put up your cable in a way that will be unobtrusive and prevent people from tripping over it  Home Depot usually carries lengths of 100 - 500ft or more
2. Secure your ethernet with cable clips (most require a hammer to install) sample: https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Circle-cable-clips-100pcs/dp/B0019R6SO0
3. Be sure to give yourself a little bit of slack on both ends
4. Slowly work your way from one end to the other. Remember if you donâ€™t have time to do it right the first time, when will you have time to do it right a second time?
